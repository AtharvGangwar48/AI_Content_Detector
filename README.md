# AI Content Detector 🧠📊

A hybrid AI-generated content detection web application developed using core **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and **Design & Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** principles. This project combines multiple algorithmic approaches such as **Hashing**, **Trie Matching**, **Heap Analysis**, and **Dynamic Programming (Edit Distance)** to analyze text and estimate whether the content is human-written or AI-generated.

## 🚀 Project Summary

The AI Content Detector prototype demonstrates how traditional algorithmic approaches can be utilized for modern AI-content detection problems. The system currently works on smaller datasets, providing high accuracy and detailed analysis using multiple algorithmic techniques. In the future, this prototype can be expanded into a full-fledged scalable system with higher computational resources to process larger datasets.
